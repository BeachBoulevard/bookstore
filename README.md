# Project Title

BOOKSTORE APP

## Project details
*  This webapp is majorly focused on its backend capabilities. It was made entirely on docker.
The major purpose of this app was to practice integrating and using Django's core features and capabilities, alongside several third party provisions. As such it may be challenging to display the features on the frontend. However, I will continue updating its look and feel, as I also populate the database to make it more interactible.

The services and customizations utilized include;
* Custom User Model and Admin
* PostgreSQL
* Django's allauth
* Django Crispy Forms
* UUIDs instead of slugs and pks
* User permissions
* Stripe payment systems, using Stripe's APIs. This can be accessed at the */orders* page
* Filtering using Q objects
* Heroku deployment as a PaaS
* Django-debug-toolbar
* Several security enhancements including but not limited to, *protection from SQL injection and XSS*.
* Django's allauth
* Django's allauth
